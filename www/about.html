	    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <!-- Main hero unit for a primary marketing message or call to action -->
      

      <!-- Example row of columns -->
      <p>I was born and raised in South Jersey; about 15 minutes from Philadelphia. I grew up drawing and designing anything I could think of, I guess you could say my childhood talent was drawing. As I grew, so did my artistic talent and love for being creative. Throughout all my years in school, I was heavily involved in my art classes and was learning new techniques and building my talent.<br />

<br />In my early High School years, my creative side took a turn towards music. I started to play drums, guitar and writing songs. Before you knew it, I was in a band and we were part of the South Jersey punk scene. After over 10 years of playing music and in and out of bands, I decided to take a break from the scene as everyone, including myself, was "growing up" and had jobs or other priorities to attend to.<br /><br />

I still love to play and write music in my free time, but then again, my creative side took another turn to writing. I recently wrote a 130 page screenplay. I still work on it to get it just right, as I'm a perfectionist, while I try to get it the exposure I feel it deserves.<br /><br />

In 2010 I decided to go back to school to fulfill a passion I had with technology and computers. And one field that always snagged my attention was Web and Graphic Design. So come June, I was going to Full Sail University for Web Design & Development. And I walked away with a broad knowledge of the field. I was taught design tools such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Flash and Premier. Then Client-Side languages such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery. I also learned Server-Side Programming using MAMP that includes PHP and MySQL. While I was learning these useful tools, I was taught the ins and outs of the production phases, such as conducting client surveys and building wireframes, site maps and design comps, all the way to the launch phase.<br /><br />
